H3K9Me3 ChIPseq in Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts
From Mikkelsen '07 (|doi:10.1038/nature06008) 

Methods:

MEFs (genotype 129SvJae X C57Bl/6; male; E13.5; passages 4-6) were grown in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin / streptomycin at 37degreesC, 5%CO2

ChIPed using Upstate protocol (www.upstate.com):
Chromatin fragmented to 200-700bases. 
H3K4me3 antibody Abcam 8580
Protein A-Sepharose

DNA fragments blunt-ended with T4 DNApol, phosphorylated using T4 polynucleotide kinase and a single A was added to 3' with Klenow. 
Double-stranded Solexa adaptors (75bp with a T overhang) ligated to fragments and products between 275 and 700bp were gel purified on 2% agarose and subjected to 18 PCR cycles.
Sequencing on Illumina / Solexa. Reagents from Solexa Cluster Amplification kits and sequences processed as per manufacturers instructions.

Illumina / Solexa sequencing with 25-50 base reads.
Obtained an average of 10 million successful reads consisting of the terminal 27-36 bases of each fragment.

Expression Data

Notes from paper:

* MEFs are multipotent ex vivo. They have been shown to differentiate into adipocytes, chondrocytes, osteoblast-like cells.

* H3K4me3 is catalysed by trithorax-group (trxG) proteins and is associated with activation.

* Virtually all high CpG promoters in ESCs are associated with significant H3k4me3 enrichment, typically in a punctate interval of 1-2Kb
* Strong correlation between gene expression and enrichment of H3k4me3 
* Not all promoters associated with H3K4me3 are active
* around 22% of high CpGs are bivalent for H3k4me3 and H3K27me3 and these genes tend to show low activity

* Most HPCs marked with H3K4me3 in ESCs retain this mark in NPCs and MEFs (unsurprising as HPCs tend to be housekeeping genes)
* Around 4% gain H3K27me3 in MEFs, including Sox2
* The majority of bivalent HPCs in ESCs resolve to a single mark in committed cells.

* low CpG promoters show a different pattern.
* Small number of LCPs have significant H3K4me3 in ESC and almost none have H3K27me3
* Most lose the H3K4me3 mark in NSC and MEF, although a small number gain it
* In all 3 cell types, expression level of associated genes correlates strongly with presence or absence of H3K4me3
* Genes with H3K4me3 LCPs are closely related to tissue function. In MEFs these include extracellular matrix components and GFs

* Genes with alternate promoters may have multiple distinct chromatin state. 

* Co-modification with H3K4me3 and H3K9me3 is often indicative of imprinted loci
